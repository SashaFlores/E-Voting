# E-Voting
Blockchain technology is changing the global economy, our ecosystem, and day to day life. Why not Voting?!




In our proposal, we will use a permissioned blockchain,
a variation of the consortium-based chains, which uses the
proof-of-authority(POA) consensus algorithm. In proof-ofauthority-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. This process
is automated and does not require the validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. A permissioned blockchain
which uses the POA consensus algorithm enables us to set
restrictions on a set of selected known entities to validate and
certify transactions on the blockchain and censor transactions
arbitrarily, with their identity and reputation at stake. This
otherwise needs to be done by miners on a public blockchain
which uses the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Rather
than employing mining fees, like the public blockchains in
operation require, using a permissioned blockchain, validators
get payed for the service they provide by acting as validators
in the system. Moreover, using a private network limits the
possibility for an eavesdropper to monitor traffic or read the
incoming data. This is needed to fulfill voting rights so that
voters can cast votes without leaking their identity or voting
data.
1) Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are trackable and
irreversible applications that execute in a decentralized environment (e.g., blockchain). Once the smart contract has been
deployed nobody can edit the code or change its execution
behavior. Smart contract execution guarantees to bind parties
together to an agreement as written. This creates a new
powerful type of trust relationship that does not rely on a
single party. Smart contracts enables better management for
realizing and administering digital agreements because they
are self-verify
