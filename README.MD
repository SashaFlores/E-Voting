##  Blockchain technology is changing the global economy, our ecosystem, and day to day life. Why not Voting?!



#### EZVote is a decdecentralized voting application build on top of Ethereum  in the form of a smart contract. The election authority issues public keys for eligible voters that they can then use to vote for their favorable candidate from the comforat of their home.




### Countries that conducted Elections on the blockchain
**Sierra Leone** is a country on the southwest coast of West Africa. it  conducted a Blockchain-based voting system on March 7 and became the first country to become so. Leonardo Gammar of Agora, stored votes in an immutable distributed ledger, thereby offering instant access to the election results.


**Russia**  launched a blockchain-based electronic voting system pilot project in June 2019.

## Tools Used to build this project:

**1- Blockchain Testnet build on Ethereum using proof-of-authority(POA) consensus algorithm.**

for more detailed instructions on how to build PoA blockchain testnet, [you can refer to this repo.](https://github.com/SashaFlores/Blockchain_Developement)




**2- Smart Contracts**

 I have developed this contract in two different versions:

   * [1-ArrayContract](1-ArrayContract) 
   * [2-RoleBasedAccessContract](2-RoleBasedAccessContract) 

**3- Ganache**

is our local blockchain that established in the first step, you can download from this link:

[Ganache site](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

and create a workspace in localhost(127.0.0.1) with port 8545

**4-MetaMask**

It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node

-------------------
Next Development:

Stay tuned, soon I will be working to develop frontend for this contract.
